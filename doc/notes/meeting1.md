# Notes for first meeting

## 1. Planning

- Working days:

  - **Sunday** and **Monday** all day.
  - **Thuesday** only after lunch. I have a WPO before lunch so I can be on campus and thus come work in the lab. Any progress presentations required can happen on these moments.

- Approach:

  1. Start by doing two days of literature and a half day of coding/preparing for coding. Starting with EEG and then NLP.
  2. Gradually go towards one day of literature and one and a half days of coding.
  3. In the second semester, gradually go from coding to writing.
